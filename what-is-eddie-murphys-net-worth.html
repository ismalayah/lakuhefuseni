He also played Donkey in the Shrek films, a franchise that remains utterly beloved to this day.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=312 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>Murphy defined comedy for a number of years, going on to become one of Hollywood’s most popular stars between the late ’90s and early 2010s. His voice helped a number of family-friendly films to reach new heights, elevating movies like Mulan and the aforementioned Shrek series to newfound heights.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>His career highs have earned Murphy huge paychecks over the years.
