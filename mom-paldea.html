Already in your uniform and everything! Well, it is your first day at your new school, after all. I'm so excited for you! Still, you might want to cool your engines before you go racing out the door. The school contacted me and said that you're supposed to wait here a little while longer. Their words, not mine! Apparently there's something very important for your first day that still hasn't arrived."</i> <i>"Maybe that's the very thing we're waiting for! &lt;player>, get the door, would you?"</i> <i>"The <a href=# title=Clavell>director</a>?! And you came in person to help my son/daughter with his/her first day?"</i> <i>"Goodness, you really needn't have... Since you've come all this way, can I at least offer you a cup of tea?"</i> <i>"&lt;player>, I've got a thing or two to discuss with the director here. Why don't you head back up to your room and finish getting ready for school? You'll need your bag—and your hat as well!"</i> <i>"Now, Mr. Clavell, you simply must join me for a cuppa. This way..."</i><ul><li>If talked to before changing into the academy outfit</li></ul><i>"Off you pop, &lt;player>! Go to your room and get yourself ready for school. You need your bag—and your hat, too!"</i><ul><li>After changing into the academy outfit</li></ul><i>"Oh, just look at you! All ready for your big first day!"</i> <i>"I wonder what this important thing might be... Let's follow the director out and see, shall we?"</i><ul><li>Outside the player's house</li></ul><i>"What a mannerly fellow that director of yours is!"</i> <i>"These three are all lovely—but you need to choose just one, right? Not an easy task!"</i> <i>"Why not take this opportunity to walk about with these little ones and get to know them? I'm sure they have lots to teach you!"</i> <i>"Oh! But before you go... I got you a little something to celebrate your big day! Take it with you if you're going out on your own."</i> <i>"It's a brand-new <a href=# title="Rotom Phone">phone</a>! According to the instructions, you can check the map app by pressing the Y Button. It'll help keep you from getting lost, so take good care of your new gadget, OK? Now off you go. Have fun!"</i> <i>"Oh, &lt;player>! I hear that Nemona here will be taking you to school?"</i> <i>"So you've already managed to make a friend!"</i> <i>"And I've read about all the wonderful teachers you'll have looking after you at the school. Plus so many handy facilities you can use as much as you like! Add in your new friend, Nemona, and it sounds like your school life is shaping up to be fantastic!"</i> <i>"Now, you'll be staying in the school dorms, so I want you to promise me you'll eat proper meals. Here's a bit of spending <a href=# title="Pokémon Dollar">money</a> to start off with. I also packed a <a href=# title="Sandwich (item)">lunch</a> for your first day!"</i> <i>"Oh! And maybe you'd better take these, too."</i> <i>"Use them on that precious little partner of yours, should it get hurt in battle. I know every day in your new life is going to be full of exciting experiences, far from home. Just try to savor them all—the good times and the hard times, too! But if you ever want to come back home, you know your bed is always ready for you."</i> <i>"Oh, all right then! You two had better be off, I suppose. Take care on the way to school!"</i><ul><li>If talked to</li></ul><i>"Study hard and play hard, that's what I say! You should enjoy your days as a student."</i><ul><li>When <a href=# title=Arven>Arven</a>, <a href=# title=Penny>Penny</a>, and Nemona visit the player's house</li></ul><i>"How's everybody doing? Anyone want dessert? I was thinking of bringing up some sweets..."</i> <i>"Hehe! Oh, sweetie, no need to stand on ceremony here! Just make yourselves at home and relax!"</i> <i>"Oh, and &lt;player>—a letter came for you. It's from..."<a href=# title=Kieran>Kieran</a>." Do you know a Kieran?"</i> <b>Yes</b>: <i>"My word, you've been making plenty of friends!"</i> <b>No</b>: <i>"Really? Well, that's odd... Still, it WAS addressed to you, so I suppose I shouldn't read it."</i> <i>"Here you are."</i> <i>"I'll bring those sweets up in just a few. I hope you'll all enjoy them!"</i> <i>"Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing! But no need to lift a finger. You kids just take it easy."</i> <i>"Oh, did Nemona and the others leave already? Your friends are all such nice kids. I was really glad to meet them all. And now it sounds like you're all about to go have a little adventure together, hm? Well, have fun if you do! No fighting, and be sure to look after one another!"</i><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4K8rquHiZilnJWWdg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nastassja-kinski.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nastassja Kinski movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-winslow-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Winslow Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./an-underrated-retrospective-war-movie-survives-the-streaming-battlefield.html>An underrated retrospective war movie survives the streaming battlefield</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charissa-thompson-the-tv-host-whos-redefining-sports-broadcasting.html>Charissa Thompson: The TV Host Whos Redefining Sports Broadcasting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-moxley-biography-age-weight-parents-wife-wrestling-wwe-njpw-contract-finisher-seth-rollins-injury-upcoming-match-and-net-worth.html>Jon Moxley Biography, Age, Weight, Parents, Wife, Wrestling, WWE, NJPW, Contract, Finisher, Seth Rol</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyssa-mikesell-3.html>Alyssa Mikesell Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sahira Nair movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash.
