She’s going through the motions of attending birthing classes and preparing a nursery, but she seems unsettled and uncertain. Enter a new friend at class named Jenny (<a href=#>Tina Majorino</a>), who offers to be a much-needed support structure for these terrifying times. Of course, from the minute anyone who knows they’re watching horror movie sees Jenny they’ll suspect something is very wrong with her, and “Delivered” turns early from a character drama about a hesitant mother to a survival thriller more akin to “<a href=#>Misery</a>” than “What to Expect When You’re Expecting”.</p><p>When “Delivered” focuses on its two female protagonists, it’s viciously effective, thanks largely to the committed, complex work by Majorino, who gives one of the best performances in the “Into the Dark” series. These films haven’t really allowed for interesting character work. I realized while watching “Delivered” how often these Blumhouse originals&nbsp;hinge on concept instead of character, but that the best ones, including “<a href=#>Culture Shock</a>” and “<a href=#>New Year, New You</a>,” are anchored by strong performances. Majorino is fantastic here, finding the tragic undercurrents under her character that make her even scarier than if she had just been a caricature. She plays trauma with even a tinge of regret over what she’s doing, making Jenny far more three-dimensional than she would have been in a lesser version of the same film.</p><p>Sadly, Tammi and writer <a href=#>Dirk Blackman</a> (“<a href=#>Outlander</a>”) resort to a few too many obvious techniques. There are at least four times when Val has a nightmare and it starts to feel like she needs to talk to someone about her bad dreams more than anything else (the “it was just a dream” thing feels like a way to pad out a thin story that doesn’t even run 80 minutes with credits). There are other cheap screenwriting turns too, like an address conveniently written on a notepad and left in a place for a rescuer to find it, and newspaper clippings that are easily discovered to provide Jenny's backstory.&nbsp;</p><p>However, every time I almost wrote off “Delivered” for tricks like these, Majorino would do something to bring me back. Like <a href=#>Kathy Bates</a> did with Annie Wilkes, she reckons with the sadness beneath the sociopathology, which makes her way more interesting than your standard pregnancy horror villain. After all, having kids may be scary, but nothing is scarier than crossing paths with the wrong grown-up.</p><p>Premieres on Hulu today, 5/8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ipa2nXam1pnnDmqmkZZSauarCxKucnWWdpMOqsYyrnK%2Bhlax6c3yRaQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-ridiculous-6-2015.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Ridiculous 6 movie review (2015)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carol-burnett-children-jody-hamilton-erin-hamilton-and-carrie-hamilton.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carol Burnett Children : Jody Hamilton, Erin Hamilton, and Carrie Hamilton</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./an-underrated-retrospective-war-movie-survives-the-streaming-battlefield.html>An underrated retrospective war movie survives the streaming battlefield</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charissa-thompson-the-tv-host-whos-redefining-sports-broadcasting.html>Charissa Thompson: The TV Host Whos Redefining Sports Broadcasting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-moxley-biography-age-weight-parents-wife-wrestling-wwe-njpw-contract-finisher-seth-rollins-injury-upcoming-match-and-net-worth.html>Jon Moxley Biography, Age, Weight, Parents, Wife, Wrestling, WWE, NJPW, Contract, Finisher, Seth Rol</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyssa-mikesell-3.html>Alyssa Mikesell Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sahira Nair movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash.
