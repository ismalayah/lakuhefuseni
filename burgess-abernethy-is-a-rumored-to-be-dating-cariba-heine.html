Several rumors about his relationship make it difficult to forecast anything. There were speculations about him dating his girlfriend, Cariba Heine, but none of them confirmed it. Time will tell whether they were dating or simply buddies. The duo looks fantastic together.</p><h2>Cariba Heine, Rumored Girlfriend</h2><p>Cariba Heine is a stunning actress best known for her roles in H2O: Just Add Water and Blue Water High.&nbsp;Burgess may have fallen in love with her because of her attractiveness.&nbsp;She is South African and is exceptional in both acting and appearance. She has a million-dollar grin.</p><p>Cariba Heine is an enthralling actress who has already earned a name for herself on the big screen. Her performance as Bridget Sanchez in Blue Water High sparked a lot of discussions. She also nailed the part of Phyllis in The Pacific. Her performance in the television film A Model Daughter: The Killing of Caroline Byrne was also noteworthy.</p><h2>New Girlfriend On The Block?</h2><p>There’s another twist to the plot as well. They don’t seem to be dating since Cariba is dating her boyfriend and partner, Jamie Timony. However, Burgess has also uploaded images of other women on his Instagram account, making it difficult to determine who he sees. He has also posted images with a few other girls on his Instagram account. He may be dating one of them and has chosen not to publicize it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Burgess-Abernethy-2.jpg><h2>New Girlfriend?</h2><p>Burgess posted this photo with a beautiful lady on his Instagram account and wished everyone a Merry Christmas. He has added two love signs to the caption, which may imply that they are a real-life pair. He may be dating a new female. However, this has yet to be verified.</p><h2>Burgess Abernethy Net Worth in 2023</h2><p>He has a lot of money from his work on TV series and movies. <strong>Burgess Abernethy’s net worth is about $2 million as of December 2023,</strong> and he has to secure new jobs to increase it to a million dollars. His net worth will approach millions in the following years if he gets excellent jobs with decent pay, which there is little chance of his getting. He is a talented actor with a great profile, and acquiring the correct positions should be no issue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Burgess-Abernethy-1.jpg><h2>Lifestyle</h2><p>He has a comfortable and fantastic life, owing to his consistent income.
