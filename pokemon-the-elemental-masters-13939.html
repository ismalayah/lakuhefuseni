He wears a blackshirt with blue, green, and red slightly dabbed along the edges of it. He also has a XIV slightly Ekchetd along his shirt with his with a light majenta. On the bare parts of his skin, regarding his arms, it was covered with black and brown elastic belts that he could easily move in, yet still use as a slight leather armor. His hands were covered with a pearl white gloves, and small metal anklet's around his wrists. From the waist down, he had a black belt with some about normal sized jeans. They draped down to his ankles with plenty of wrinkles and crevices along the way. He wears some fancy black shoes, and on his shoulders he wears a long black cloak that dripped all the way down to his feet<br>Starting Equipment: Scythe, two level six cards(or one, if you don't want me to have two), and a silver flute, etched the elemental stains of ether on it.<br>Personality: A vry large, thinker. Loves to evaluate the situation before acting, and towards people, he seems more deolet than the averege Joe. He seems to be a randomed emotion guy when around people he cares about, and is truly loving for his own pokemon, and beliefs.<br>History: I was born in an off-spring way, living in a cherished, loving enviroment, and frolocking my days in hapiness. Around my childhood, I was about 10, and the new maytrs, or mages, as they called them, were starting to pop up everywhere. I had to stay in and study much, but by age 12, I had already been taken in as one of there ranks. They apparently sensed my White eye, or holiness to be able to see spirits. I was sent to studying for many years, and saw other mages, less combated than me, run into the battle feild. I asked one of my elders one day why such mutany was afoot, me not going into battle when such a youngin is. He awnserd, my aura was more bound for explaniation, but not action. I gre angry by this, and was sent to my quarter's for the day, no supper to live by. In that ttime, I felt like re-constructing my simple lief into something far more complex. I had secretly snnuck into the elders library once, and uncoverd a book on legends. It told of the many legends in this world. Of articuno, Zapdos,Moltres, even the mighty Ruriako, but there was somthing lse that caught my eye. It was in the back of the book, dislaying a rare Mew Fossil, saying it is supposed to be one of the rarest beings ever in existance. I grew intruiged, and learned more of it. It was a confusing mesh of strange entitys, always confusing me the mor I learnt, but finally coming to a conclusion. Mew, was ether. The entity of all entitys. Mew is supposed to be the one true pokemon in which all others are based off of. COuld it be more sacred then Rurakio? More important, even though the legends say otherwise..? My will to find this out grew, and one day, I grabbed m scythe, two seal cards, and my lovely bulbasaur taht I have kept since I was a child, and secretly underwent myself as a travelling mage. I was deemed ready, and was thrust into the world of pokemon to capture the spirits of like from the evil mage, Allara. That name stil..intruiges me. No, I can't dwindle in other matters, I am going to capture the elements of life aright..but even though i've tudied so much of this legend, I feel, perhaps, theres somthing..odd about Ruriako. But eiher way, the mage's goal is no longer mine..for the moemnt. It just to summon, and just be able t catch a glimpse, at least, of the divin ether pokemon, Mew.<br>Pokemon: Bulbasaur.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHyxu8qepKimXam1pnnEpZymnZ6prq15zJqqrZ2iqHtyf5hscGiokZyybn4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./diletta-leotta-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-117482-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Diletta Leotta Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./philip-defranco-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Philip DeFranco Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./an-underrated-retrospective-war-movie-survives-the-streaming-battlefield.html>An underrated retrospective war movie survives the streaming battlefield</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charissa-thompson-the-tv-host-whos-redefining-sports-broadcasting.html>Charissa Thompson: The TV Host Whos Redefining Sports Broadcasting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-moxley-biography-age-weight-parents-wife-wrestling-wwe-njpw-contract-finisher-seth-rollins-injury-upcoming-match-and-net-worth.html>Jon Moxley Biography, Age, Weight, Parents, Wife, Wrestling, WWE, NJPW, Contract, Finisher, Seth Rol</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyssa-mikesell-3.html>Alyssa Mikesell Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sahira Nair movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash.
