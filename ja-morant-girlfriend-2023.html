He played college basketball for the Murray State Racers, where he was a unanimous first-team All-American as a sophomore in 2019.</p><p>Despite being named All-Region Most Valuable Player three times and earning All-State honors at Crestwood High School in Sumter, South Carolina, Morant was only lightly recruited by NCAA Division I programs and was unranked by recruiting services. Even after this, he made an immediate impact at Murray State University, earning first-team all-Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) honors as a freshman. In his sophomore season, he was named OVC Player of the Year and led the NCAA in assists.</p><p>Additionally, as a sophomore, Ja Morant made history by becoming the first player in NCAA history to finish a season with an average of 20 points and 10 assists. Morant is one of the NBA's brightest young stars, with a new signature Nike shoe, a best-selling jersey, and a Memphis Grizzlies team poised for a deep postseason run.</p><p>Following his appearance in the NBA, Ja Morant has gained a lot of popularity, and fans online are curious about Morant's relationship and wonder if he has a girlfriend or if he is single in 2023. Well, here's everything you need to know.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>relationship status</a></strong> of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Cole Sprouse</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Eva Green</strong></a>.</p><h2>Ja Morant‚Äôs Girlfriend in 2023: The 23-Year-Old NBA Player Is in a Relationship With Kadre Dixon; The Couple Also Shares a Beautiful Child/ Daughter Together!</h2><p><strong>Ja Morant</strong> is the most well-known player in the NBA. The 23-year-old young professional basketball player can frequently be found on the court for the <strong>Memphis Grizzlies </strong>shooting hoops. However, away from the NBA spotlight, the 23-year-old point guard is also the father of one daughter. As of 2023, the two-time All-Star is said in a relationship with his long-term girlfriend <strong>Kadre/KK Dixon</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@kkdixonnn</a>) off the court.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Kadre Dixon, also known on social media as <strong>KK Dixon</strong>, was born in August 1999. The Arkansas native was a volleyball and basketball player at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. Dixon is the founder and CEO of Dixon Brands LLC, as well as the author of a children's book, Kaari & Kree's Ultimate Coloring & Activity Book, which is available on Amazon. In addition to her relationship with the 2019‚Äì2020 Rookie of the Year, Dixon was a college athlete at Fisk University, where she competed in basketball and volleyball.</p><p>Ja Morant and Dixon first met as freshmen in college at Murray State University in Kentucky, where the NBA star was attending. The couple started dating in 2017 but decided to make their relationship official a year later, in 2018. Later, Morant and his girlfriend welcomed their first child together after being in a relationship for over two years. Both parents are frequently photographed with their daughter, <strong>Kaari Jaidyn Morant</strong>, born on August 7, 2019. Dixon reportedly nearly died while pregnant with Kaari due to pre-eclampsia around the 31st week of her pregnancy.</p><p>They also have a joint Instagram account dedicated to the three-year-old, where they frequently post pictures of her taking naps, going on trips, or watching her father play football on TV. Dixon used the account on August 10, 2020, to wish her husband a Happy Birthday from his two best girls, <a href=# rel=noopener>writing</a>:</p><p><strong>Happy Birthday to the best dada in the world. She don‚Äôt play about him lol. It was a lot of naps and listening to lil baby for them before the bubble happened! But it is a blessing to have a dad who loves and provides like he does üíïü§ûüèΩHAPPY 21st BDAY!!!</strong></p><p>However, the couple has not been married as of right now. But there's a high chance that we could see them as a husband and a wife very soon.</p><h2>Ja Morant‚Äôs Fourth NBA Season Has Been a Mixed Bag!</h2><p><strong>Ja Morant</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@jamorant</a>) will play in his second All-Star Game in as many seasons.
