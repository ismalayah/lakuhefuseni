Without breaking a sweat, I must add. That said, the self-proclaimed hero hunter we got to know in season 2 has the making of a worthy opponent, although we are yet to see him at his best (or worst, depending on how you look at it). Luckily, we’ll get to see more of Garou in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season 3 of One Punch Man</a>.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Announced in August 2022, the new season is expected to continue adapting the Monster Association arc, expanding on the conflict between monsters and heroes. Of course, judging by the source material, Garou will be a key player, so fans of this character have something to look forward to. The only question that remains is when exactly season 3 is coming out.</p><h2 id=h-does-one-punch-man-season-3-have-a-release-date data-injectable=false>Does One Punch Man season 3 have a release date?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/one-punch-man-garou.png><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>For the time being, season 3 of One Punch Man doesn’t have a release date, nor a confirmed release window. This is tragic news to any fans like myself, who have been waiting for more episodes since season 2 concluded its run in January 2020. The wait has been long, but if we take a moment to think it through, it’s not too surprising, as we had to wait three years between seasons 1 and 2.</p><p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>That said, it’s hard not to be worried about the lack of news. With season 3 reportedly being animated by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MAPPA</a>, One Punch Man may have fallen victim to the studio’s behind-the-scenes issues, which have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">also impacted anime such as Jujutsu Kaisen</a>. Then again, spending years without any sort of update on a MAPPA project is something that fans have already gotten way too familiar with. (The studio may have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">forgotten about the Yuri!!! on Ice movie</a>, but we certainly haven’t.)</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Despite all that, without a cancellation announcement, at least we know that the third season of One Punch Man is still in the works, and that’s what’s truly important here. It’s just a matter of time until we see Saitama back on our screens, but in the meantime, you can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">catch up on the manga</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rewatch the first two seasons</a> on Hulu and Crunchyroll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6iqmasmJq%2FpnnAZqannV2lwq%2Bvx2akmqZdqLKiv86nZGxlopq5pq3SnmSdmaSafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sanaa-zainab-kaid.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>More About Robert Salehs Wife Sanaa Saleh Did You Know They Have Seven Children?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heaven-is-for-real-2014.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heaven Is for Real movie review (2014)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./an-underrated-retrospective-war-movie-survives-the-streaming-battlefield.html>An underrated retrospective war movie survives the streaming battlefield</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charissa-thompson-the-tv-host-whos-redefining-sports-broadcasting.html>Charissa Thompson: The TV Host Whos Redefining Sports Broadcasting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-moxley-biography-age-weight-parents-wife-wrestling-wwe-njpw-contract-finisher-seth-rollins-injury-upcoming-match-and-net-worth.html>Jon Moxley Biography, Age, Weight, Parents, Wife, Wrestling, WWE, NJPW, Contract, Finisher, Seth Rol</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyssa-mikesell-3.html>Alyssa Mikesell Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sahira Nair movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash.
