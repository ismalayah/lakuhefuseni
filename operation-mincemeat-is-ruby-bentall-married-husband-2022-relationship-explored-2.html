However, because none of the forecasts are from an official source, they cannot be believed.</p><p>As a result, Ruby’s relationship status will remain a mystery until she speaks out about her personal life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=find-out-the-age-of-ruby-bentail></span>Find Out The Age Of Ruby Bentail<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ruby Bentall is a 21-year-old actress who was born in London, England, on April 3rd, 1988, to Paul Bentall and Janine Duvitski.</p><p>Between 2004 and 2006, she attended Grey Court School and Richmond upon Thames College, earning a BTEC National Diploma in Performance.</p><p>On March 30, 2014, it was revealed that Bentall would represent Ross Poldark’s cousin Verity in the new BBC One adaptation of Poldark, which would air in 2015.

Her family has been pursuing acting as a career, so it’s safe to assume she got her acting DNA from them.</p><p>And it’s not only Ruby who has inherited Paul and Janine’s performing DNA; her siblings are all actors.</p><p>Ruby’s brothers, Jack and Albert Bentall, are actors, and her sister, Edith Bentall, is the main vocalist of the “FOURS” band.</p><p>Ruby and her family members appear to have made a promise to delight the world with their diverse talents.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=find-out-the-net-worth-of-ruby-bentall></span>Find Out The Net Worth Of Ruby Bentall<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of 2021,&nbsp;Bentall’s net&nbsp;worth is predicted to be between $1 million and $5 million dollars.</p><p>This includes her property, funds, and earnings.
