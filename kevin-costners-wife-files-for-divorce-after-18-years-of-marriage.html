The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellowstone</a> star married Christine Baumgartner in 2004, and the couple have three children together.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>When the divorce was first reported, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> shared that the cause of the split was unknown but that Christine claimed their split was due to “irreconcilable differences.” Meanwhile, Kevin’s representatives released a statement about the divorce and asked the public and the media to respect the couple’s and their children’s’ privacy during these times.</p><p>“It is with great sadness that circumstances beyond his control have transpired which have resulted in Mr. Costner having to participate in a dissolution of marriage action. We ask that his, Christine’s, and their children’s privacy be respected as they navigate this difficult time.”</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>It was reported that both Kevin and Christine applied for joint custody of their children, ages 12, 14, and 15, and that Baumgartner didn’t ask for any spousal support. In a news release shared late this afternoon by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PEOPLE</a>, it’s now being reported that a source shares that Costner’s intense filming schedule led to a split for the pair.</p><p>“Christine wants them to spend family time at their Santa Barbara home. During filming, Kevin is not around very much. His absence has been very hard for her.”</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=140 data-injectable=false>Continuing, the source allegedly notes that Yellowstone took Costner away from home and his family in more ways than he initially realized.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10>“Kevin hasn’t been home very much for quite some time due to filming, the popularity of&nbsp;Yellowstone, and the time necessary for his other projects. He has been in demand. All of this success and excitement over the new project probably took his attention away from his family more than he realized. Since it didn’t look like that would change and likely could get worse, it caused tension at home.”</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Christine is Costner’s second wife after his previous 16-year marriage to Cindy Silva ended in 1994. She is a model and handbag designer who dated Costner for four years before their marriage at his ranch in Colorado. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmopolitan</a>, the former couple met at a golf course back when Costner was still in his first marriage with Silva. This was when Costner was rehearsing for his role in&nbsp;Tin Cup.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>It was also reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Magazine</a>&nbsp;that Costner and Christine were spotted together from time to time after their first meeting. The two briefly dated before pulling the plug in 2003 due to their opinions about having children. However, they gave their relationship another shot before they got married a year later, staying together for almost two decades.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=false>Asides from these two marriages, Costner had a brief relationship with Bridget Rooney, who gave birth to his son in 1996. He also dated political activist Birgit Cunningham and supermodel Elle Macpherson.
