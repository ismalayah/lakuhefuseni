One famous face, however, appears to be largely absent from the new season.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Heather Rae El Moussa (née Young) has been on the show since the very first episode, as a core member of the Oppenheim real estate empire. Over the course of the show, she has made a name for herself in the world of high-end homes, married fellow property mogul Tarek El Moussa, and documented her journey into motherhood, all while balancing work and family life – so why has she seemingly left the series?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-heather-rae-el-moussa-leave-selling-sunset data-injectable=false>Why did Heather Rae El Moussa leave Selling Sunset?</h2><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Heather Rae El Moussa confirmed her departure on Instagram on November 3rd, writing “It’s bittersweet to not be a part of&nbsp;SS&nbsp;anymore,” to her three million followers, as documented by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a>. “But I do know that good or bad I wouldn’t change the experiences I had.”</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>The reason for her exit, however, is not so clear. At the start of her new post, El Moussa hinted at some sort of factor that influenced her decision to leave and move on to pastures new. “Everything happens how it’s meant to 🤍,” the 36-year-old wrote. “And we all have a plan.”</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>El Moussa seemingly hinted that she had left the show last month, when she was absent from new promotional images for season 7, even hinting that something “pushed” her out of the cult reality series.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>“Looks like I got pushed in the water … it’s a good thing I can swim,” she wrote on Instagram. “Congrats to my girls on S7! 💗You may see me in a few episodes. 💁🏼‍♀️.”</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>While perhaps a subtle comment that is up to interpretation, “a few” seemed to imply not all episodes, but the realtor’s comments are not entirely clear, even now.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>El Moussa did state back in March that she would be absent for much of season 7 because she was on maternity leave. “Season seven is filming right now, but I’ve been off maternity leave and I’ve been excited to get back to work,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she told E! News </a>at the time.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>However, she did go on to say that she had not been asked to return to work as normal, adding that “so far I have not been called back, It’s been a little frustrating. So [I’m] not sure what’s been going on.” Perhaps this is what she meant about being “pushed” out of the new season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Will Heather Rae El Moussa Return to Selling Sunset?</h2><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>As noted by “see me in a few episodes,” Heather Rae El Moussa’s exit from Selling Sunset is not a clean-cut withdrawal from the show. So far, her season 7 appearances have been pretty sporadic, although typically brief.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Other cast members, such as Maya Vander, dropped down to a guest role after five seasons on the show, appearing occasionally. Others have been bumped up a grade in their role on the show. For example, Romain Bonnet jumped from recurring to main between seasons 1 and 2, before eventually becoming recurring once more after season 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahsGaho6PBbrTEmquhnaJiv6KxjJ6jZqWfqsC0rYyipWarlaG5qrrGZqqupqOawW6%2FxJqqqKZdbHq4tculZKyglWK%2FpsDUq6Vmnp%2Bneq670Z5krJ2RqLyvv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dale-midkiff-bio-wiki-age-family-grilfriend-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dale Midkiff Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Grilfriend, Movies, TV Shows and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sebastien-roblin-wikipedia-everything-to-know-about-journalist.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sebastien Roblin Wikipedia: Everything To Know About Journalist</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./an-underrated-retrospective-war-movie-survives-the-streaming-battlefield.html>An underrated retrospective war movie survives the streaming battlefield</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charissa-thompson-the-tv-host-whos-redefining-sports-broadcasting.html>Charissa Thompson: The TV Host Whos Redefining Sports Broadcasting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-moxley-biography-age-weight-parents-wife-wrestling-wwe-njpw-contract-finisher-seth-rollins-injury-upcoming-match-and-net-worth.html>Jon Moxley Biography, Age, Weight, Parents, Wife, Wrestling, WWE, NJPW, Contract, Finisher, Seth Rol</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyssa-mikesell-3.html>Alyssa Mikesell Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sahira Nair movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash.
