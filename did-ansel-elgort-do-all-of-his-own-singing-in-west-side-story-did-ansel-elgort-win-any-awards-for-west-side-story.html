He sang some of his own parts, but other parts were sung by a ghost singer. This is a common practice in film musicals, where actors may not have the vocal range or training to sing all of their own parts.</p><p>In the case of West Side Story, the ghost singer for Ansel Elgort was Robin de Jesus. De Jesus is a Broadway actor and singer who has starred in several musicals, including In the Heights and Hamilton. He was also the understudy for the role of Tony in the original Broadway production of West Side Story.</p><p>De Jesus’s vocals can be heard on several of the songs in the film, including “Something’s Coming,” “Maria,” and “Tonight.” His vocals are blended with Elgort’s vocals to create a seamless sound.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=did-ansel-elgort-win-any-awards-for-west-side-story></span>Did Ansel Elgort win any awards for West Side Story?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ansel Elgort was nominated for several awards for his performance in West Side Story, but he did not win any. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and a Critics’ Choice Movie Award for Best Actor. He also won the Hollywood Critics Association Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy.</p><p>Some people believe that Elgort was snubbed by the Academy Awards, as he was not nominated for an Oscar for his performance. However, it is important to note that the Academy Awards are voted on by a small group of people, and there are many factors that go into who is nominated. It is possible that Elgort’s performance was simply not seen by enough people to warrant a nomination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZmXqiutKeo2adnJy8s8CMnaZmmZyherCyjKGgrGWfrLtuv8innqKml2K2r3nWnqqtZaOesaZ50q2mq7FdmbalecCnqp6kXZq5qLvRrWSwoZ5irq%2FFjJqumqqUqHqnu9Fmrp6rpGLAqrDEZqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-pickens-jr-biography-wiki-grey-anatomy-age-wife-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Pickens Jr Biography, Wiki, Grey Anatomy, Age, Wife and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./samantha-streets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Samantha Streets movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./an-underrated-retrospective-war-movie-survives-the-streaming-battlefield.html>An underrated retrospective war movie survives the streaming battlefield</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charissa-thompson-the-tv-host-whos-redefining-sports-broadcasting.html>Charissa Thompson: The TV Host Whos Redefining Sports Broadcasting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-moxley-biography-age-weight-parents-wife-wrestling-wwe-njpw-contract-finisher-seth-rollins-injury-upcoming-match-and-net-worth.html>Jon Moxley Biography, Age, Weight, Parents, Wife, Wrestling, WWE, NJPW, Contract, Finisher, Seth Rol</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyssa-mikesell-3.html>Alyssa Mikesell Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sahira Nair movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash.
