She has been in several other movies without attracting a great deal of attention, but here she is unmistakably and wonderfully a star, a tousled-haired, big-eyed warm person who does not project sex appeal so much as warmth and humor. In other words, she has terrific sex appeal.</p><p>One of Belushi's special qualities was always an underlying innocence. Maybe he created his Blues Brothers persona in reaction to it. He's an innocent in this movie, an idealist who's a little kid at heart and who wins the love of Brown not by seducing her but by appealing to her protective qualities. That's the secret of the character's appeal. We're cheering for the romance because Belushi makes us protective, too, and we want him to have a woman who'd be good for him.</p><p>What about the movie's view of journalism? It's really just a romanticized backdrop, “The Front Page” crossed with "Lou Grant" and modernized with a computerized newsroom. The newspaper scenes in the movie were shot on location in the Sun-Times features department, and one of the quietly amusing things about "Continental Divide's" view of newspaper life is that in the movie it's more sedate and disciplined than the real thing. In the "real" Sun-Times features department, there's a lot of informality and chaos and good-natured confusion and people shouting at one another and eating lunch at their desks. In the movie, the extras (recruited from the Sun-Times staff) forget about real life and sit dutifully at their video display terminals, grinding out the news.</p><p>The newspaper's managing editor is played by <a href=#>Allen Goorwitz</a>, a gifted character actor who usually plays manic overcompensators, but who this time is reasonable, calm, civilized, compassionate, and understanding, just like my boss. The movie's city of Chicago is populated by colorful old newsstand operators, muggers who apologize before taking your watch, and city council bosses who make sure their shady deals don't get into the official transcript. The newsies and muggers are fiction. The movie itself is fun: goofy, softhearted, fussy, sometimes funny, and with the sort of happy ending that columnists like to find for their stories and hardly ever find themselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cpqesmaOyr8DApWSdoaaesaZ5kHJvag%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eyal-sabuke-suite-niger.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eyal Sabuke Suite, Niger</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1079603-becky-lynch-challenges-sasha-banks-amid-speculation-over-her-future.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Becky Lynch Challenges Sasha Banks Amid Speculation Over Her Future</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./an-underrated-retrospective-war-movie-survives-the-streaming-battlefield.html>An underrated retrospective war movie survives the streaming battlefield</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charissa-thompson-the-tv-host-whos-redefining-sports-broadcasting.html>Charissa Thompson: The TV Host Whos Redefining Sports Broadcasting</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jon-moxley-biography-age-weight-parents-wife-wrestling-wwe-njpw-contract-finisher-seth-rollins-injury-upcoming-match-and-net-worth.html>Jon Moxley Biography, Age, Weight, Parents, Wife, Wrestling, WWE, NJPW, Contract, Finisher, Seth Rol</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./alyssa-mikesell-3.html>Alyssa Mikesell Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Sahira Nair movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash.
